# Auto Backup Program
This program, as the name implies is an automatic backup program. It runs in command line, and starts the backup as soon as you open it. It is simple to use and easy to set up.

# Discontinued!
I'm sad to announce that I am discontinuing Auto Backup Program. This means that there will be no more updates, and the update server has been closed. The program will not be downloadable using the installer, since the update server is no longer available. If you want to use this program, you will have to download the source code from my GitHub.

# Features
* Automatic system shutdown after backup.
* Automatic deletion of old backups.
* FTP support.
